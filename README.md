# cfdtoybox

I decided to modify a CFD toybox based off of Dan Schroeder's excelent [JavaScript simulator](http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/fluids/)

The idea is to have experiemnts that show various appects of the physics I'm learning in PHYS101 including drag force in laminar, and turbulent flow.

The simulation uses the ever increasingly popular [lattice-Boltzmann algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods) which has seen some recent peformance updates by the [SpaceX guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYA0f6R5KAI)

I also hope to add a crude form of gravity to the simulation, however I'm not expecting the results to be very accurate except at relatively low gravities (g=0.1 or so).
